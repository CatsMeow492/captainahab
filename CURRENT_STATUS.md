## 🔍 Recent Bug Fixes (Today)

### Issue: Polling Errors
**Problem:** `'int' object has no attribute 'encode'` errors preventing monitoring  
**Root Cause:** `sha_key()` function couldn't handle integer inputs  
**Fix:** Convert all inputs to strings before encoding  
**Result:** ✅ Polling works perfectly now

### Issue: Slack 400 Errors
**Problem:** Trying to send 2000+ alerts at once overwhelmed Slack  
**Root Cause:** Initial catchup on historical data created too many messages  
**Fix:** Batch limit of 10 events per alert, send summary instead  
**Result:** ✅ Alerts send successfully

### Debugging Method Used:
- ✅ Exported Fly.io env to local
- ✅ Ran Captain Ahab locally for rapid iteration
- ✅ Verified fixes work, then deployed
- ✅ Much faster than deploy-wait-check cycle!
