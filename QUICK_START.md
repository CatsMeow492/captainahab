# üöÄ Quick Start - Hyperliquid Alert Service

## ‚úÖ What's Ready

**Good news:** Your Hyperliquid alert service is **100% functional** and ready to use!

- ‚úÖ Code tested with live Hyperliquid data (2000+ fills retrieved)
- ‚úÖ Slack webhook configured
- ‚úÖ VIP address monitoring enabled (`0xb317d2bc2d3d2df5fa441b5bae0ab9d8b07283ae`)
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fly.io Deployment Blocked

Unfortunately, Fly.io has an infrastructure issue with their internal registry (401 errors). This is **not a problem with your code** - it's their service.

**The workaround:** Run it locally on your machine until Fly.io is fixed!

## üèÉ Start Monitoring Now (Local Mode)

### Option 1: One-Command Start (Easiest)

```bash
cd /Users/taylormohney/Documents/GitHub/captainahab
./run_local.sh
```

That's it! The service is now running and monitoring the VIP wallet.

### Option 2: Manual Start

```bash
cd /Users/taylormohney/Documents/GitHub/captainahab
source venv/bin/activate

export WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
export WATCH_ADDRESSES="0xb317d2bc2d3d2df5fa441b5bae0ab9d8b07283ae"
export VIP_ADDRESSES="0xb317d2bc2d3d2df5fa441b5bae0ab9d8b07283ae"
export DB_PATH="./local_seen.db"

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## üì± What You'll See

### In Terminal
```
[START] Monitoring 1 addresses (VIP: 1)
[CONFIG] Poll interval: 30s, Lookback: 10min
[CONFIG] Short threshold: $25,000,000, Deposit threshold: $20,000,000
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### In Slack
When the VIP wallet (`0xb317...`) makes **ANY** trade or deposit:

```
üö® VIP WALLET Hyperliquid Alert ‚Äì 0xb317d2bc...283ae

üö® VIP TRADE
‚Ä¢ Type: SELL SHORT_OPEN
‚Ä¢ Token: BTC-USD
‚Ä¢ Amount: 1000 @ $95,000
‚Ä¢ Notional: $95,000,000.00
‚Ä¢ Time (UTC): 2025-10-18T23:50:00Z
‚Ä¢ Tx: 0xabc123...
```

## üîç Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Health Endpoint
Open in browser: http://localhost:8080/health

Should show: `ok`

### 2. Watch Logs
The terminal will show:
- `[INFO] No WATCH_ADDRESSES or WEBHOOK_URL configured, skipping scan` (only if misconfigured)
- `[ALERT] X new event(s) for 0xb317... (VIP: True)` (when activity detected)
- `[WARN] fetch error for...` (if API has issues)

### 3. Test Slack Webhook
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"‚úÖ Hyperliquid monitor is LIVE!"}' \
  https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

You should get a test message in Slack!

## üõë Stopping the Service

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

## üîÑ Running in Background (Keep Computer On)

### macOS - Keep It Running 24/7

```bash
cd /Users/taylormohney/Documents/GitHub/captainahab

# Run in background
nohup ./run_local.sh > monitor.log 2>&1 &

# Save the process ID
echo $! > monitor.pid

# View logs
tail -f monitor.log

# Stop later:
kill $(cat monitor.pid)
```

### Better: Use Screen (Survives Terminal Close)

```bash
# Start screen session
screen -S hyperliquid

# Run the service
./run_local.sh

# Detach: Press Ctrl+A, then D
# Reattach later: screen -r hyperliquid
```

## üìä Monitoring Details

### What Triggers Alerts

| Wallet | Event | Threshold | Alert |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **VIP** (0xb317...) | ANY trade | None | üö® Yes |
| **VIP** (0xb317...) | ANY deposit/withdrawal | None | üö® Yes |
| Regular | Short open | ‚â• $25M | Yes |
| Regular | USDC deposit | ‚â• $20M | Yes |

### Polling Frequency
- Checks every **30 seconds**
- Initial lookback: **10 minutes** of history
- Then tracks incrementally (no duplicates)

### Data Sources
- **Hyperliquid API**: `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info`
  - `userFills` - trade history
  - `userNonFundingLedgerUpdates` - deposits/withdrawals

## üîß Customization

Edit `run_local.sh` to change:

```bash
export POLL_SECONDS="60"              # Check every minute instead
export USD_SHORT_THRESHOLD="10000000" # Lower threshold to $10M
export LOOKBACK_MINUTES="60"          # Look back 1 hour on start
```

Add more addresses:
```bash
export WATCH_ADDRESSES="0xb317...,0x9eec9...,0x9263..."
export VIP_ADDRESSES="0xb317...,0x9eec9...,0x9263..."
```

## üìù Finding the Other VIP Addresses

You mentioned two partial addresses from the Trump tariff incident:
- `0x9eec9...`
- `0x9263...`

### Where to Look:

1. **Hyperliquid Explorer**
   - https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/explorer
   - Filter by large BTC/ETH shorts
   - Look for timing around the tariff announcement

2. **HypurrScan**
   - https://hypurrscan.io
   - Check leaderboards for top shorts

3. **Twitter/CT**
   - Search: "hyperliquid insider trading trump tariff"
   - Look for wallet addresses in discussions

4. **Once Found:**
   - Edit `run_local.sh`
   - Add full addresses to `WATCH_ADDRESSES` and `VIP_ADDRESSES`
   - Restart the service

## üéØ When Fly.io is Fixed

When Fly.io resolves their issue (check https://status.fly.io):

```bash
cd /Users/taylormohney/Documents/GitHub/captainahab

# Try deploying again
flyctl deploy

# If successful, stop local version and use cloud:
kill $(cat monitor.pid)  # if running in background
```

Then your service runs 24/7 on Fly.io without needing your computer on!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### No Alerts Appearing

1. **Check wallet has activity:**
   - Visit https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/explorer
   - Search for `0xb317d2bc2d3d2df5fa441b5bae0ab9d8b07283ae`
   - Verify recent trades exist

2. **Test Slack webhook:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"text":"test"}' \
     YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   # If running with nohup:
   tail -f monitor.log
   
   # Look for errors
   grep ERROR monitor.log
   ```

### Service Crashes

```bash
# Check what went wrong
cat monitor.log

# Restart
./run_local.sh
```

### High CPU Usage

Normal! It polls every 30 seconds. To reduce:

```bash
# Edit run_local.sh
export POLL_SECONDS="120"  # Check every 2 minutes
```
